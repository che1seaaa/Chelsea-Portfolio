### About Me 
Hello! My name is Chelsea Ayitey-Adjin, and I am a sophomore in Political Science and Biohealth double majoring at Loyola University Maryland. My experience as an undergraduate student at Loyola has equipped me with communication, writing, leadership, and analytical skills which will be necessary in my future profession as a lawyer.

These skills helped me obtain a campaign internship with Senator Angela Alsobrooks. During my time in this role, I organized and participated in grassroots events and helped promote the ALSOBROOKS FOR MD Campaign.

My diverse skill set and passion for advocacy make me an ideal candidate, in my free time, I enjoy listening to music and reading in my spare time.

You can find me on LinkedIn @ChelseaAdjin
